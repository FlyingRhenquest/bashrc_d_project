Bashrc project. My home bashrc iterates down into this directory. It
first runs (sources) bashrc_d/`uname -s`/`hostname -s`/*.sh. Then it
runs bashrc_d/`uname -s`/all/*.sh. Then it runs bashrc_d/all/*.sh.
You could optionally add a pre-init/post-init phase to this, but I've never
found the need to do that, and I run some pretty complex environmental
configs on my systems.

It sources the scripts in alphabetic order, so if you want something
to run before something else, you can adjust its filename. You can
use the rc_d trick of prefixing files with numbers if you wish (1_blarg.sh
will run before 2_blarg.sh etc, but keep in mind that numbers are
sorted alphabetically, not numerically.

In the top level bashrc_d directory there's a scripts directory you can
put scripts in. For scripts that don't need to change, you can put them
there and symlink them to the systems you want them to run on. You can
put scripts that need to change there too, and just copy them into the
system directories when you want to change them. If you need more scripts
directories at the OS levels, feel free to make them.

To make a new directory for a new system, (Note backticks) 
mkdir ~/bashrc_d/`uname -s`/`hostname -s` && 
ln -s ~/bashrc_d/scripts/placeholder.sh 
~/bashrc_d/`uname -s`/`hostname -s`/placeholder.sh (You can remove
the placeholder once you start symlinking scripts into that directory
to configure the system environment.

Check the bashrc_d/Linux (Assuming you're running Linux) directory
to make sure it's the way you want it prior to installing. I install
bash completion, turn off Ubuntu's obnoxious "command not found" message
and set my prompt the way I like it. YMMV.

If you want your default environment to be gnu screen, symlink
scripts/screen.sh to 01_screen.sh (or 01_a_screen.sh) on each machine
you want this to happen on. This would be a good argument for a pre-init
phase if you want screen to run everywhere, since you'd typically want
screen to run before anything else. The screen.sh script will not run
screen if the terminal is not interactive or if screen is already running.
